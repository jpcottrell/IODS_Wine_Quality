Wine is produced, enjoyed, and studied all around the world, but what makes one wine better than another? 

This project seeks to uncover and explore the relationships between key wine characterics and chemical qualities to determine what makes one wine average and another one exceptional.

For this study, I will be using the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learing Repository, found here: [Wine Quality Data Set] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

The data is comprised of two data sets corresponding to red and white variants of Portugese Vinho Verde wine. 

Combined, the dataset includes reviews of 4898 wines with the following variables:

Input variables: 
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
